SEGMENTS IN ORDER:
  1. THE PROBLEM       (1:30-2:00 min)  - Direct transfer is traceable
  2. CODE: DIRECT      (1:30-2:00 min)  - Show sender/recipient/amount visible
  3. THE SOLUTION      (2:30-3:00 min)  - 4 hops, 48 paths each
  4. CODE: PRIVACY     (2:00-2:30 min)  - SDK implementation
  5. COMPARISON        (1:30-2:00 min)  - Side-by-side privacy metrics
  6. TRACING ATTACK    (1:30-2:00 min)  - Why observer can't find path

================================================================================
OPENING STATEMENT (30 seconds):
================================================================================

"Every transaction on the blockchain is a permanent fingerprint of your 
financial activity. Today, I'm going to show you how to hide that fingerprint.

We'll trace a simple transaction: Alice sends 1 SOL to Bob. First the normal 
way—which is completely traceable. Then the private way—where they can't."

================================================================================
KEY TALKING POINTS (Don't memorize, just internalize):
================================================================================

PROBLEM SEGMENT:
  ✓ "All four pieces of information are permanent on chain"
  ✓ "Anyone can track your financial history"
  ✓ "Privacy score: 0 out of 100"

DIRECT CODE SEGMENT:
  ✓ Point at fromPubkey → "Visible on chain"
  ✓ Point at toPubkey → "Visible on chain"  
  ✓ Point at amount → "Visible on chain"

SOLUTION SEGMENT:
  ✓ "Instead of direct, funds travel through 4 hops"
  ✓ "Each hop splits into 48 paths—4 real, 44 fake"
  ✓ "An observer sees all 48 but doesn't know which are real"
  ✓ [BUILD TO]: "By hop 4, there are 5.3 million possible paths"

PRIVACY CODE SEGMENT:
  ✓ "For developers, it's one function call"
  ✓ "You don't need to understand the cryptography"
  ✓ "Privacy becomes the default"

COMPARISON SEGMENT:
  ✓ [SLOW DOWN] Point at Direct column → "Everything visible"
  ✓ [PAUSE] Point at BlackoutSOL column → "Everything hidden"
  ✓ "Privacy score: 0 vs 94 out of 100"
  ✓ "Anonymity set: 1 vs 5.3 million"

TRACING ATTACK SEGMENT:
  ✓ "Imagine an attacker trying to trace Alice's path"
  ✓ "Hop 1: 1 in 48 chance"
  ✓ "Hop 2: 1 in 2,304 chance"
  ✓ "Hop 3: 1 in 110,592 chance"
  ✓ "Hop 4: 1 in 5,308,416 chance (impossible)"

SUMMARY SEGMENT:
  ✓ "One function call gives you 5.3 million anonymity"
  ✓ "Production-ready today"
  ✓ "Military-grade privacy without sacrificing speed"

================================================================================
WHAT TO POINT AT DURING DEMO:
================================================================================

Segment 1:
  → Sender address line
  → Recipient address line
  → Direct arrow connection (Alice → Bob)
  → Privacy score: 0/100

Segment 3:
  → Each HOP section
  → "48 possible paths" for each hop
  → The math: 48 → 2,304 → 110,592 → 5,308,416

Segment 4:
  → maxHops: 4
  → fakeSplitsPerHop: 44
  → MAXIMUM_PRIVACY

Segment 5:
  → Left column: Direct Transfer (all ✅)
  → Right column: BlackoutSOL (all ❌ hidden)
  → Anonymity Set row (1 vs 5.3M)
  → Privacy Score row (0/100 vs 94/100)

Segment 6:
  → HOP 1 section (48 paths)
  → HOP 2 section (mixed sources)
  → HOP 3 section (timing randomized)
  → HOP 4 section (final destination)
  → The [????] arrow diagram

================================================================================
PACING GUIDE:
================================================================================

Segments 1-2: SLOW (30-45 seconds per section)
  → Let people understand the PROBLEM
  → Show concern, seriousness

Segments 3-4: MEDIUM (1-1.5 minutes per section)
  → Build momentum toward the SOLUTION
  → Emphasize the key innovation

Segments 5-6: MEDIUM-SLOW (1-1.5 minutes per section)
  → This is the "wow" moment
  → Let numbers speak for themselves
  → Pause after "5.3 million"

Segment 7: NORMAL (confident, wrap-up tone)
  → Quick recap
  → Clear takeaway
  → Strong close

================================================================================
THINGS TO SAY (naturally, not as script):
================================================================================

✓ "Here's the problem..."
✓ "Watch what happens when..."
✓ "Notice this is..."
✓ "This is where it gets interesting..."
✓ "By the end, there are 5.3 million possible paths"
✓ "That's the difference between traceable and impossible to trace"
✓ "For developers, it's just one function call"
✓ "Privacy becomes the default"

================================================================================
THINGS NOT TO SAY:
================================================================================

✗ Don't read the script word-for-word (sounds robotic)
✗ Don't apologize for showing code (be confident)
✗ Don't dive into cryptographic proofs (not production-ready anyway)
✗ Don't claim "impossible to hack" (mention audit in progress)
✗ Don't say "um" and "like" (edit them out if you do)
✗ Don't look uncomfortable with the terminal (you know what you're doing)

================================================================================
IF YOU MESS UP:
================================================================================

Option 1: Keep going
  → You can edit out mistakes later
  → Small stumbles are fine

Option 2: Pause and re-do that section
  → Stop recording
  → Start from beginning of section
  → Splice good takes together

Option 3: Start completely over
  → It's fine. You'll be more confident.
  → Your genuine delivery > perfect script reading

================================================================================
BEFORE YOU PRESS RECORD:
================================================================================

Checklist:
  ☐ Terminal is clean
  ☐ Font is large (14pt+)
  ☐ Microphone is tested
  ☐ "npm run demo:video" works
  ☐ OBS Studio is recording
  ☐ Red recording indicator is visible
  ☐ This quick reference is nearby
  ☐ VIDEO_TALKING_POINTS.md is open

================================================================================
AFTER YOU STOP RECORDING:
================================================================================

1. Let video file save completely (~5 seconds)
2. Play back first 30 seconds to verify audio/video
3. Save file to: /recordings/zeclipsesol-demo-raw.mp4
4. Keep raw file, make edits on a copy
5. Export final version
6. Upload with title: "BlackoutSOL: Private Transactions on Solana (Demo)"

================================================================================
THE 30-SECOND SUMMARY (if someone asks what the video is about):
================================================================================

"Normal blockchain transfers are completely traceable. BlackoutSOL breaks that
link by routing transfers through 4 hops with 48 paths each, creating 5.3 
million possible transaction paths. An observer can see every transaction but 
can't tell which was the real one. It's one API call for developers, so privacy
becomes the default instead of something specialized. Perfect for payments,
credentials, any financial data."
